​Implement everything learnt from Bootstrap and jQuery to recreate a landing page for a studio.The 'What we do'  icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icon. The description should be centered aligned. The header should be in bold and centered also. This should be achieved by using jQuery.Create a Hover effect for the **Portfolio ** sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background. This should be achieved using jQuery.The site should be responsive.
